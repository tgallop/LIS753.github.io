            <h2>All About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Taylor Gallop, I am going into my fourth year of teaching and will be a second grade teacher next year. This is my first time switching grades as a teacher and I am nervous but excited for the challenge. I am hopeful that a switch in age and schools can bring me a more successful year that is full of new memories!</p>
            <p>I have been taking courses through Dominican University for over two years now and have received my first masters degree in the art of education as well as my endorsement in English as a Second Language Education. I am currently working to get my MLIS degree and attempting to finish all my courses before May of this year!</p>
